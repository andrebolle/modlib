Explicit multiple buffering

This solution is fairly simple. You simply create two or more buffer objects of the same length. 
While you are using one buffer object, you can be modifying another. Depending on how much 
parallelism your implementation can provide, you may need more than two buffers to make this work.

The principle drawback to this solution is that it requires using a number of different buffer 
objects (separate buffer handles). So you'll need to change which buffers you're using for 
your GPU operations every frame.
